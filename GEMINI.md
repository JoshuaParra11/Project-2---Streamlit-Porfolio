# Project Overview

This project is a Streamlit portfolio designed to showcase data visualization coursework for CS39AE. It utilizes Python with the Streamlit library to create an interactive web-based presentation of data analysis and visualization projects. The project is in its early stages, with the main application file (`app.py`) yet to be implemented.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Python:** The core programming language.
*   **Streamlit:** The framework for building the interactive web application.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **Folium:** For creating interactive maps.

**Architecture:**

The project follows a simple structure:

*   `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
*   `Requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies.
*   `Data/`: A directory intended to hold data files for the projects.
*   `README.md`: Provides a brief project description.

# Building and Running

To run this project, you need to have Python and `pip` installed.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r Requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit App:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    **TODO:** The `app.py` file is currently empty. Add Streamlit code to this file to build the portfolio application.

# Development Conventions

*   **Data:** All data files should be placed in the `Data/` directory.
*   **Dependencies:** All Python dependencies should be added to the `Requirements.txt` file.
*   **Code Style:** Follow standard Python PEP 8 coding style guidelines.
